# Computer Vision Course Assignment: MNIST Digit Classification

## Overview

Welcome to the MNIST Digit Classification Kaggle competition for the Computer Vision course! In this competition, your task is to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The goal is to achieve higher accuracy than the provided baseline, which uses k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

### Getting Started

1. **Join the Kaggle Competition:**
  - Follow the competition link provided to join the Kaggle competition.
  - Familiarize yourself with the competition data and evaluation metric.

2. **Clone this repository to your local machine:**
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/mshamrai-teaching/image-classification-mnist-*your-name*
     ```
3. **Navigate to the project directory:**
      ```bash
       cd image-classification-mnist-*your-name*
      ```

### Guidelines

* Dataset:
  * The MNIST dataset is provided for this competition.
* Model:
  * Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification.
  * Transfer learning is not allowed; students should only use CNN architecture.
* Baseline:
  * The provided baseline uses k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
  * Your goal is to beat the baseline accuracy using CNN.
* Evaluation:
  * You will be evaluated based on the leaderboard score.
 
### Hints

* Model Architecture:
  * Design an appropriate CNN architecture for image classification.
  * Experiment with different architectures, layers, and activation functions.
* Training Strategy:
  * Adjust hyperparameters, such as learning rate and batch size.
  * Consider data augmentation to improve model generalization.
  * Explore regularization techniques, such as dropout and batch normalization.


### Submission
To submit your solution commit your files to the `main` branch. 

Ensure your final submission includes:
* Source code (mnist_cnn.py or similar).
* A brief report (report.md or similar) explaining your CNN architecture, training strategy, and any challenges faced.

### Evaluation

Your solution will be evaluated based on the accuracy achieved in the Kaggle competition. The goal is to surpass the baseline accuracy obtained using k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

Good luck, and may the best CNN prevail! If you have any questions, feel free to reach out.
